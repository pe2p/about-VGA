A graphics card is an expansion card for your PC that is responsible for rendering images to the display.
High-end GPUs are used for <strong>gaming, <u>ray tracing</u>, graphics production, and even <u>mining cryptocurrency</u>.</strong>.
<h1>VGA...</h1>
<br>A graphics card (also called a video card, display card, graphics adapter, or display adapter) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. At the core of both is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations, but should not be confused with the graphics card as a whole, although "GPU" is often used as a metonymic shorthand to refer to graphics cards.
<p style="margin-top:30px;">Most graphics cards are not limited to simple display output. Their integrated graphics processor can perform additional processing, removing this task from the central processor of the computer.[1] For example, Nvidia and AMD (previously ATI) produced cards that render the graphics pipelines OpenGL and DirectX on the hardware level.[2] In the later 2010s, there has also been a tendency to use the computing capabilities of the graphics processor to solve non-graphic tasks, which can be done through the use of OpenCL and CUDA. Graphics cards are used extensively for AI training, cryptocurrency mining and molecular simulation.[2][3][4]</p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">Usually, the graphics card is made in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) and inserted into an expansion slot, universal or specialized (AGP, PCI Express).[5] Some have been made using dedicated enclosures, which are connected to the computer via a docking station or a cable. These are known as eGPUs.</p><p style="margin-top=100px"></p>

<h3>1.First, we should think about what the <u>Ray tracing</u> do in the game...</h3><br></head>
<body>
<p>In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.</p>
<p>On a spectrum of computational cost and visual fidelity, ray tracing-based rendering techniques from ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping to path tracing are generally slower and higher fidelity than scanline rendering methods.[1] Thus, ray tracing was first deployed in applications where taking a relatively long time to render could be tolerated, such as in still computer-generated images, and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suited to real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.</p>
<p>Ray tracing is capable of simulating a variety of optical effects,[5] such as reflection, refraction, soft shadows, scattering, depth of field, motion blur, caustics, ambient occlusion and dispersion phenomena (such as chromatic aberration). It can also be used to trace the path of sound waves in a similar fashion to light waves, making it a viable option for more immersive sound design in video games by rendering realistic reverberation and echoes.[6] In fact, any physical wave or particle phenomenon with approximately linear motion can be simulated with ray tracing.</p>
<p>Ray tracing-based rendering techniques that involve sampling light over a domain generate image noise artifacts that can be addressed by tracing a very large number of rays or using denoising technique</p>

<h3>2.Second, we should think about what the <u>DLSS</u> do in the game.</h3><br></head>
<body>
<p>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a temporal image upscaling technology developed by Nvidia and exclusive to Nvidia graphics cards for real-time use in select video games, using deep learning to upscale lower-resolution images to a higher-resolution for display on higher-resolution computer monitors. Nvidia claims this technology upscales images with quality similar to that of rendering the image natively in the higher-resolution but with less computation done by the video card allowing for higher graphical settings and frame rates for a given resolution.[1] Nvidia claims “DLSS 2.0 offers image quality comparable to native resolution”.[2]</p>
<p>As of June 2021, this technology is available exclusively on GeForce RTX 20 and GeForce RTX 30 series GPUs.</p>
